Fuse Network is the decentralized EVM-compatible public blockchain that powers the Fuse platform and ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of Fuse Network.

The Fuse Network blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) for achieving consensus. The consensus is secured by a significant number of independent validators, only one of which is run by the Fuse core team.

Fuse is a decentralized blockchain-powered platform and technology stack whose goal is to enable genuine mass adoption of crypto payments and decentralized finance (DeFi). 

The project was launched in 2019 by a team formerly involved in building the Colu project aimed at bringing local currencies to the blockchain.
