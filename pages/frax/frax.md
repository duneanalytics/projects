**Frax is the world’s first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin.**
The Frax Protocol introduced the world to the concept of a cryptocurrency being partially backed by collateral and partially stabilized algorithmically.

Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain – currently implemented on Ethereum and other chains. The end goal of the Frax protocol is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC. 

The Frax protocol is a two token system encompassing a stablecoin, **Frax (FRAX)**, and a governance token, **Frax Shares (FXS)**.
