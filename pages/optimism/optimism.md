Optimism is a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain built by Ethereum developers, for Ethereum developers. Built as a minimal extension to existing Ethereum software, Optimismâ€™s [EVM-equivalent architecture](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306) scales your Ethereum apps without surprises. If it works on Ethereum, it works on Optimism at a fraction of the cost.

We pledge to uphold the values of Ethereum by producing infrastructure that promotes the growth and sustainability of public goods. See more at [optimism.io/about](https://www.optimism.io/about)
