Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD - a USD pegged stablecoin, and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.

In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort.

Liquity protocol is non-custodial, immutable and governance-free.
