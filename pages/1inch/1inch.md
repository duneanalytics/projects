1inch is a distributed network for decentralized protocols on Ethereum and BSC (Binance Smart Chain) enabling the most lucrative, fastest and protected operations in DeFi (decentralized finance).

The 1inch Network consists of 5 distinct yet interoperable components:

- The 1inch Aggregation Protocolfacilitates cost-efficient and secure atomic transactions by utilizing a wide range of protocols and performing argument validation and execution verification. Users leverage the Aggregation Protocol anytime they interact with 1inch in order to find and execute the most efficient transactions across DEXes.

- The 1inch Liquidity Protocol is a next-generation automated market maker that protects users from front-running attacks and offers capital efficiency to liquidity providers.

- The 1inch Network is governed by the 1inch DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that enables 1INCH stakers to vote for key protocol parameters and take part in the network’s governance.

- A key contributor to the 1inch Network is 1inch Labs, a decentralized group of software builders that develop a range of open-source protocols governed by users through the 1inch DAO.

- The 1inch Foundation is a non-profit organization that issued the 1INCH token and is dedicated to fostering the 1inch Network and initiatives that benefit the network’s community. The 1inch Foundation incentivizes contributions through grants and other capital deployment vehicles.
