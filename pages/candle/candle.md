Candle takes a different approach to blockchain tech than other platforms. They want to be more than just for developers - they want to be your gateway to the blockchain. Their platform is easy-to-use and super-efficient, which allows them to offer zero-to-low transaction fees without any compromises in security.

Currently in beta, but that's not stopping them from being the most popular blockchain out there!

Candle believes in Web3 for all. Candle is an EVM-based scaling platform that enables developers to build user-friendly dApps with zero-to-low transaction fees without sacrificing security.

Candle (CNDL) is the American rival to Russia's Ethereum and India's Polygon. It is decentralized and therefore has essentially little to no centralized leadership or organizational structure. Those who are involved with the network describe it as a manufacturing/production focused blockchain, with the eventual goal of increasing the value stored in the protocol through large trade surpluses.
