**The Liquid Staking Solution for PoS Blockchains**
Lido is a liquid staking protocol for multiple PoS blockchains acked by industry-leading staking providers. stETH is the market-leading liquid staking derivative on the ETH network.

**Strengthening Network Infrastructure**
Lido lets users stake their ETH - without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure - whilst participating in on-chain activities, e.g. lending.

**Unlocking Liquidity**
Lido attempts to solve the problems associated with initial ETH staking - illiquidity, immovability and accessibility - making staked ETH liquid and allowing for participation with any amount of ETH to improve performance of the Ethereum network.

**Decentralized Governance**
The Lido DAO governs a set of liquid staking protocols, decides on key parameters (e.g., fees) and executes protocol upgrades to ensure efficiency and stability. LDO is the Ethereum token granting governance rights in the Lido DAO.
