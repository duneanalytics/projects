**Fund anything**
The programmable funding protocol for builders and creators. Light enough for a group of friends, powerful enough for a global network of anons. Community-owned, on Ethereum.
Built for:

* DAOs
* Crowdfunding
* NFT projects
* Indie creators and builders

**Programmable spending**
Commit portions of your funds to the people or projects you want to support, or the contributors you want to pay. When you get paid, so do they.

**ERC-20 community tokens**
When someone pays your project, they'll receive your project's tokens in return. Tokens can be redeemed for a portion of your project's overflow funds; when you win, your community wins with you. Leverage your project's token to grant governance rights, community access, or other membership perks.

**Redistributable surplus**
Set a funding target to cover predictable expenses. Any extra funds (overflow) can be claimed by anyone holding your project's tokens alongside you.

**Transparency & accountability**
Changes to your project's funding configuration require a community-approved period to take effect, which acts as a safeguard against rug pulls. Your supporters don't have to trust you â€” even though they already do.
