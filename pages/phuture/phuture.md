Phuture is a decentralised asset management protocol focused on crypto index products. Phuture simplifies investing into crypto by providing access to managed portfolios of crypto assets through a single index token. Index products are managed by Phuture, but the protocol's permissionless design allows anyone to become an index manager. 

Phuture's index products provide instant diversification to your portfolio, automatic rebalancing of assets within the index, improved returns by generating interest on idle assets as well as a tax efficient way of managing your investments.
