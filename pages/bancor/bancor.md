The Bancor Protocol is a fully on-chain liquidity protocol that can be implemented on any smart contract-enabled blockchain. The Bancor Protocol is an open-source standard for liquidity pools, which in turn provide an endpoint for automated market-making (buying / selling tokens) against a smart contract.

- Bancor Network currently operates on the Ethereum and EOS blockchains, but the protocol is designed to be interoperable for additional blockchains. 
- Our implementation can be easily integrated into any application enabling value exchanges. 
- Our implementation is open source and permissionless, and ecosystem participants are encouraged to contribute to and enhance the Bancor Protocol.
