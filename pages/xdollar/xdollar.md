xDollar is the first cross-chain decentralized lending platform on multi-chains with DAO governance component and multi-collateral vault system. In recognizing the Liquity protocol thorough designed operating mechanism, xDollar has the features and benefits consistent with the Liquity protocol.

To begin our decentralized borrowing journey, xDollar starts with the Polygon network and will eventually expand into other chains/protocols. 

Furthermore, we have designed a new tokenomics to support xDollarâ€™s long-term vision.
