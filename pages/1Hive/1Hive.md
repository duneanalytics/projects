The Dai stablecoin is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency 
soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Dai is held in cryptocurrency wallets or within 
platforms, and is supported on Ethereum and other popular blockchains.

Dai is easy to generate, access, and use. Users generate Dai by depositing collateral 
assets into Maker Vaults within the Maker Protocol. This is how Dai is entered into 
circulation and how users gain access to liquidity. Others obtain Dai by buying it 
from brokers or exchanges, or simply by receiving it as a means of payment.
