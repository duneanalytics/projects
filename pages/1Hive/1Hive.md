1Hive is a community that builds and experiments with decentralized applications 
and protocols. At the center of these experiments is an effort to build 
a sustainable and thriving economy around a currency called Honey, which is used 
to influence the direction of the community.

As an open community, anyone can join and participate in 1Hive. The barriers 
to entry are extremely low; simply show up and start to contribute. We already have 
several programs which reward contribution with Honey including the Honey Faucet 
and Pollen that donâ€™t require any upfront capital, and we have fostered a culture 
that encourages community mentorship, inclusion, and taking initiative.
