Tornado improves transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between recipient and destination addresses. It uses a smart contract that accepts ETH deposits that can be withdrawn by a different address. Whenever ETH is withdrawn by the new address, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit, ensuring complete privacy.

In this way, Tornado.cash acts as a proxy to ensure that the transaction is 100% anonymous with zkSnarks proofs.
