Tokenlon is a decentralized exchange and payment settlement protocol based on blockchain technology.

Tokenlon 4.0 is based on an improved off-chain Request for Quotation (RFQ) architecture built on the 0x DEX protocol. With on-chain settlement, Tokenlon provides users with a trading experience that does not require trust, has neither slippage, nor front running. Since its launch in July 2019, Tokenlon 4.0 has 120,000 users that traded a total volume of over $4B. Thanks to its design, the on-chain settlement success rate is 99.6%, far ahead of other DEX protocols.
