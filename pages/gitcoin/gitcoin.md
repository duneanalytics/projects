Gitcoin is a community of over 300k active developers and builders. We’ve helped thousands of projects and teams grow open source ecosystems with over $70M in funding. We believe in financial freedom, global coordination, and a brighter collective future for the open web. We’re building the world’s leading platform for running web3 events (gitcoin.co/hackathons) and building & funding open source projects (gitcoin.co/grants).
