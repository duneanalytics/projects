zkBob is a stablecoin-based privacy application deployed on Polygon and Optimism and designed for everyday users and common use cases. zkBob uses zkSNARKS to anonymize senders, receivers, and amounts when transferring stable funds.

Compliance features deter bad actors and illicit usage, giving privacy and safety back to ordinary blockchain users.

zkBob is optimized to work with the BOB token, a multi-chain stable token (stablecoin) enhanced with optional privacy. Other tokens such as ETH, USDC and others will appear later.

The main components of zkBob ecosystem are the following:

1. zkBob is a zk-based privacy application built for stablecoin transfers. It accepts BOB stablecoins for deposit, and once deposited in the zkBob app, BOB can be transferred anonymously between participants. BOB can then be withdrawn from the application to an EOA (externally owned address) preserving anonymity of the transfer amounts and participants.

2. BOB is a multi-chain & multi-collateral stable token (stablecoin) enhanced with optional privacy features. It could be acquired through swaps using apps like Paraswap, 1inch and others. BOB can also be transferred between users in a shielded form using the zkBOB application. [Learn more](https://bob-docs.zkbob.com/)

3. The Bob CDP (collateralized debt position) module allows borrowers to use various types of on-chain collateral to mint over-collateralized BOB tokens as debt. LP providers of the following pairs can mint BOB to start (minimum $100 collateral): BOB/USDC, BOB/USDT, BOB/MATIC, BOB/WETH. [Learn more](https://bob-docs.zkbob.com/bob-cdp/about)
