SKALE Network is an open-source, EVM-compatible multichain network built to scale Ethereum dApps with a focus on high-throughput, fast finality, and zero gas fee transactions via the native gas token sFuel.

The Network enables dApp developers to access validator-operated nodes compute power and storage to run fast, containerized, EVM-compatible chains called SKALE Chains.

SKALE chains can exchange transactions or messages with other SKALE Chains and the Ethereum Mainnet through the native validator secured bridge (IMA), allowing dApp developers to use SKALE for powering their dApps while enabling token and message transfers to and from Ethereum or other chains.

With SKALE, dApps run zero-cost transactions on dedicated Proof-of-Stake chains distributed across a randomly chosen set of 16 nodes.
