**Guild.xyz** is the infrastructure for platformless access management. Create portable memberships, social structures around on- & off-chain requirements and build unique user journeys across apps!

We started out as a simple bot for connecting Ethereum with Discord, inspired by our own needs for better token-gating and general access management of internet native groups.

Over time, Guild.xyz evolved to be integrated with multiple platforms like Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Google Workspace, GitHub in addition to 17 chains and several web3 protocols such as POAP, Mirror, Lens and Snapshot. Supporting a diverse set of communities like: Arbitrum, Zerion or Lil Nouns.
