Ruler Protocol is the first market-driven lending platform with non-liquidatable loans

**MARKET PRICED**
No bonding curve to determine interest rates, instead rates are decided by market demand and supply.

**NO LIQUIDATIONS**
With Ruler, as long as you follow the rules, you will never have to worry about health factors or having your position liquidated.

**FUNGIBLE LOANS**
Obtain ERC-20 loans for the time period you need. Trade your debt sheet anytime.

**DECENTRALIZED**
Ruler Protocol's smart contracts will be deployed, and verified on the Ethereum blockchain, making lending and borrowing entirely censorship resistant and open.

**LIMITLESS**
Ruler Protocol will allow you to lend out any asset. Those looking to borrow an asset are able to, as long as there are people willing to lend it out.

**NO KYC REQUIRED**
Ruler Protocol allows you to lend and borrow without needing to give up your identity.
